\section*{Preface}

This book consists of two parts: one, a primer designed to provide an adequate introduction to the essentials of abstract algebra and to some related number theory, and two, a workbook designed to enable the reader to interactively engage with colleagues in exploring the fascinating world of abstract algebra.

We have taken a problem solving approach -- the primer alone contains over 130 problems. So be prepared for minimal text material to read, combined with worksheets that extend and enhance text topics. These worksheets are designed to encourage discovery of interesting relationships between algebraic structures, geometry, mappings, and proofs.

Very little, if any, background in abstract algebra is needed for a course based on this Primer and the workbook. This material has been used successfully for over a decade with in-service secondary teachers seeking licensure or an MA degree in teaching mathematics.

In this book we embrace the oft-quoted maxim - ``You learn mathematics by doing mathematics.'' Such an effort leads to better understanding and deeper learning.

Finally, a valuable by-product: A significant number of teachers who have studied this material have incorporated a variety of the worksheets into their secondary curriculum as they encounter topics like closure, binary operations and their properties, modular arithmetic, and the structure of the integers (yes, GCD and LCM show up), and the rational and real numbers.
