\section*{Introduction}
An abstract algebra consists of a set of objects (integers, real numbers, permutations, polynomials, matrices, $\dots$), various binary operations, along with some properties (closure, inverses, commutativity,$\dots$). Examples of abstract algebras include groups, rings, integral domains, and fields. Operations include rotations of regular geometrical figures, ordinary and modular addition and multiplication, addition and multiplication of matrices and of polynomials, composition of permutation cycles, direct products and others.

In one sense the core ideas of algebra are abstracted out and viewed from a much larger lens. For example, the problem of finding analogues of the quadratic formula, around the mid 1500â€™s, led to the study of the symmetric groups which shed light on the nonsolvability of the general quintic.

Applications are plentiful. Among the many fields of study making significant use of algebraic structures we include cryptography, genetics, mineralogy, the study of molecular structures in chemistry, elementary particle theory in physics, Latin squares in statistical experiments, and finally, architecture and art.

Important contributors over the past several centuries include Joseph Lagrange, Niels Abel, Arthur Cayley, Emmy Noether, Gauss, Galois, Sylow among many others.

\section{Binary Operations}
\stepcounter{section}
The concepts of being commutative and associative are usually introduced to students as they study the four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of integers.  These four operations denoted by $+,\,-\,\times,\, \div$ are examples of binary operations.\\[.1in]

Let $S$ be any set.  A \underline{binary operation} \index{binary operation} on $S$ is  a function $f:S\times S\rightarrow S$.  Sometimes a binary operation is depicted using the \underline{infix} notation $(m,n)\mapsto m\,\square\, n$, rather than the \underline{prefix} notation $f(m,n)$.  The following are examples of binary operations on $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}$.\\
$$\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\underline{\text{OPERATION}}&\underline{\text{INFIX NOTATION}}\\
\hline
f(m,n)=m+n & m\,\square\, n=m+n\\
\hline
f(m,n)=mn & m\,\square\, n=mn\\
\hline
f(m,n)=\text{gcd}(m,n) & m\,\square\, n=\text{gcd}(m,n)\\
\hline
f(m,n)=5^m\cdot n & m\,\square\, n=5^m\cdot n\\
\hline
\end{array}$$
Additional binary operations that will be of importance include
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
f(x,y)&= x\div y \text{ on }S=\mathbb{R} \text{ where } y\neq0\\
f(m,n)& = m-n \text{ on } S=\mathbb{Z}=\{0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots\}\\
f(m,n)&=m+n-mn \text{ on }S=\mathbb{Z}\\
f(m,n)&=m+n-1 \text{ on }S=\mathbb{Z}\\
f(A,B)&=A\cup B \text{ on } P(S) \text{ for }S=\{\text{a,b,c}\}\\
f(A,B)&=A\cap B \text{ on } P(S) \text{ for }S=\{\text{a,b,c}\}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
Here, $\cup$ denotes union and $\cap$ denotes intersection.  Also, $P(S)$, the power set for $S$, is the set of all subsets of $S$.  As an example, if $S$=\{a,b\},then $P(S)$ = \{ $\emptyset$, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\} \}.

\subsection{Properties of Binary Operations}

Binary operations on a set $X$ may or may not satisfy the following properties:\\
\underline{Commutativity:}\index{commutative} $x\,\square\, y =y\,\square\, x$ for all $x,y$ in $X$.\\
\underline{Associativity:}\index{associativity} $x\,\square\,(y\,\square\, z)=(x\,\square\, y)\,\square\, z$ for all $x,y,z$ in $X$.\\
\underline{Identity:}\index{identity} An element $e\in X$ such that $x\,\square\, e=e\,\square\, x = x$ for $x$ in $X$ is called an identity for the binary operation $\square$.\\
\underline{Inverses:}\index{inverse} If $e$ is an identity under $\square$, an inverse of an element $a$ in $X$ is an element $b$ in $X$ such that $a\,\square\, b=e=b\,\square\, a$.

For example, the operation $+$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ is associative since $a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$ for all $a,b,c$ in $\mathbb{Z}$.  Since $a+b=b+a$, + is commutative.  The element 0 serves as an identity $e$ since $0+a=a+0=a$.  Each element $a\in \mathbb{Z}$ has an inverse, namely $-a$.

One important characterization or consequence of the notation $f:A\times A\rightarrow A$ is that the result $f(m,n)$, or $m\,\square\, n$, must be an element in $A$; i.e., $A$ must be \underline {closed}\index{closed, closure} under the binary operation $\square$.  So divisibility, denoted $\div$, is not a binary operation on $N=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$ since $m\div n = \frac m n$ is not necessarily an integer.  But $\div$ is a binary operation on the set $\mathbb{R}^+$ of positive real numbers.  Notice that since $2\div3\neq3\div2$, $\div$ is not commutative.
\newpage
\begin{tcexample}{}{} 
Consider the binary operation $m\,\square\, n=3^m\cdot n$ on $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$; show that $\square$ is \underline{not} associative.  The following single example accomplishes this:
$$1\,\square\,(0\,\square\, 1) = 1\,\square\, 1 = 3\text{ but }(1\,\square\, 0)\,\square\, 1 = 0\,\square\, 1 = 1$$
Does $\square$ have an identity?  it might be natural to try 0 or 1.  Since $0\,\square\, n = n$ but $n\,\square\, 0=0$, 0 is not an identity.  Since $1\,\square\, n = 3n$, 1 is not an identity.  No other element in $n$ works either;  without an identity, there are no inverses.
\end{tcexample}
\addtolength{\partopsep}{-.5in}
\begin{tcexample}{}{}
Union, $\cup\,$, is a binary operation on $P(S)$ where $S$=\{a,b,c\}.  Since $A\cup(B\cup C)=(A\cup B)\cup C$, $\cup$ is associative.   Since $\emptyset \cup A=A=A\cup\emptyset$ for all $A\in P(S)$, the empty set $\emptyset$ serves as an identity.
\end{tcexample}

When the set $A$ is finite, a binary operation $\square$ can be given by a matrix table where the element $x\,\square\, y$ is found at the intersection of row $x$ and column $y$.
\clearpage
\begin{tcexample}{}{}
Let $A=\{1,3,7,9\}$ and let $x\,\square\, y$ be the digit in the units position upon ordinary multiplication of $x$ and $y$.  This is sometimes written as $x\,\square\, y \equiv xy(\text{mod }10)$.  The matrix table is
$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\,\square\, & 1 & 3 & 7 & 9\\
\hline
1 & 1 & 3 & 7& 9\\
3 & 3 & 9 & 1& 7\\
7 & 7 & 1 & 9 & 3\\
9 & 9 & 7 & 3 & 1
\end{array}$$
This binary operation $\,\square\,:A\times A\rightarrow A$ is associative (you need to check $4\cdot4\cdot4=64$ cases), is commutative (from the symmetry of the table), has identity 1, and each element has an inverse as shown in the following table:
$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
x & 1 & 3 & 7 & 9\\
\hline
\text{inverse of }x & 1 & 7 & 3 & 9
\end{array}$$%
\end{tcexample} 

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	The binary operation $\circ$ on $A$=\{e, a, b\} given by the table below is associative, commutative and has e as an identity.  In the exercises you are asked to find inverses.\\
	\begin{minipage}{2in}
		$$\begin{array}{c|ccc}
		\,\circ\, & \text{e} &\text{a} & \text{b}\\
		\hline
		\text{e} & \text{e} & \text{a} & \text{b}\\
		\text{a} & \text{a} & \text{b} & \text{e}\\
		\text{b} & \text{b} & \text{e} & \text{a}
		\end{array}$$
	\end{minipage}

\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
Let $A=\{1,2,5,10\}$ and $m\,\square\, n = \text{gcd}(m,n)$, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$.  The matrix table for $\square$ is given.  With some effort, you can show that $\square$ is associative.The table's symmetry verifies that the operation $\square$ is commutative.  In the exercises, you are asked to determine an identity and to see if there are inverses.
\begin{minipage}{3.5in}
	$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
	\,\square\, & 1 & 2 & 5& 10\\
	\hline
	1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &1\\
	2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2\\
	5 & 1 & 1 & 5 & 5\\
	10 & 1 & 2 & 5 & 10
	\end{array}$$

	
\end{minipage}

\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 Ordinary multiplication with rounding to the nearest tenth after each multiplication is not associative. Try this one: $ (1.1)(0.3)(2.7) $.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
Define a binary operation $ \circ $ on $ \Z  $ by $ m\circ n=m+n-3. $ To find the identity $ e $, $ e $ needs to satisfy $ m\circ e=e\circ m= m. $ Since $ \circ $ is clearly commutative we need not worry about checking $ e\circ m=m. $ Then, $ m\circ e= m+e-3=m $ and $ e=3 $. As an example, $ 7\circ 3=7+3-3=7 $. What about inverses? The inverse of an integer $ p $ in $ \Z $ must satisfy $ 3=p\circ p^{-1}=p+p^{-1}-3 $ and so $ p^{-1}=6-p. $ As an example, the inverse of $ 13 $ is $ -7 $ since $ 13\circ (-7)=13+(-7)-3=3 $, the identity.
\end{tcexample}

\subsection{``An'' Identity versus ``The'' Identity}
Throughout this discussion of properties we have been saying ``an'' identity.  Here is some good news!  We can replace ``an'' with ``the'' whenever an identity exists.\\

\begin{tctheorem}{}{S1.1}
If the binary operation $\square$ on $X$ has an identity, then it is unique.
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
Proceed using a proof by contradiction.  Suppose there are two different identities; call them $e$ and $f$.  Since $x\,\square\, e=x=e\,\square\, x$ for all $x$ in $X$, it must hold for $x=f$, i.e., $f\,\square\, e= f = e\,\square\, f$.  Since $x\,\square\, f=x=f\,\square\, x$ for all $x$ in $X$, it must hold for $x=e$, i.e., $e\,\square\, f=e=f\,\square\, e$.  But then $e\,\square\, f=f$ and $e\,\square\, f =e$, or $e=f$ contradicting the fact that they were different.
\end{newproof}
Similarly, inverses are  unique.  Let $e$ be the identity for an associative operation $\circ$ on $X$, and let $g$ and $h$ be two inverses for some $a$ in $X$.  Then $g=g\,\circ\, e=g\,\circ\,(a\,\circ\, h)=(g\,\circ\, a)\,\circ\, h=e\,\circ\, h = h$.  You should give reasons for each step.

\subsection{Meet and Join}
There are two binary operations on $B$=\{0,1\} that are basic in computer design and operation.  The \underline{meet}\index{meet} $\bigwedge$ and \underline{join}\index{join} $\bigvee$operations are given by the tables below.\\[.3in]
\begin{minipage}{3in}
$$\begin{array}{c|cc}
\bigwedge & 0 & 1\\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0\\
1& 0 & 1\\
\end{array}$$
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{3.5in}
$$\begin{array}{c|cc}
\bigvee & 0 & 1\\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1\\
1& 1 & 1\\
\end{array}$$
\end{minipage}\\[.3in]
The meet operation is similar to intersection $\cap$ and join is similar to union $\cup$, and behave like the logical connectives ``and'' and ``or'' respectively.  Each of $\bigwedge$ and $\bigvee$ are commutative and associative.  Are there identities, inverses?

\subsection{Bitwise Addition Modulo 2}

Another binary operation having applications in coding theory is based on the table below.
$$\begin{array}{c|cc}
\oplus & 0 & 1\\
\hline
0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0\\
\end{array}$$
\rule{0in}{.1in}
Here, $a\,\oplus\,b$ is 0 if $a+b$ is even and $a\,\oplus\,b=1$ if $a+b$ is odd.  Equivalently, $a\,\oplus\,b=0$ if $a=b$, and $a\,\oplus\,b=1$ if $a\neq b$.  The binary operation $\oplus$ on $B=\{0,1\}$ is called ``bitwise addition modulo 2''.\index{bitwise addition}  On $B^2=\{00,01,10,11\}$, the table for $\oplus$ is given. \\[.1in]
\begin{minipage}{3.5 in}
The operation is performed bitwise; $10\,\oplus\,01=11$ since $1\,\oplus\,0=1$ and $0\,\oplus 1 =1$.  You are asked to investigate properties of $\oplus$ in the exercises.
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{3.5in}
$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\oplus& 00 & 01 & 10 & 11\\
\hline
00 & 00 & 01 & 10 & 11\\
01 & 01 & 00 & 11 & 10\\
10 & 10 & 11 & 00 & 01\\
11 & 11 & 10 & 01 & 00
\end{array}$$
\end{minipage}\\[.2in]

\section{Closure}
\stepcounter{section}
We say that a binary operation $\square$ on a set $S$ is CLOSED \index{closed, closure} if whenever $a$ and $b$ are any two elements in $S$ then $a\,\square\, b$ is also in $S$.  For example, the operation $+$ is closed on the set $S=\mathbb{Z}=\{0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots\}$ since $a+b$ is in $\mathbb{Z}$ for $ a,b\in \mathbb{Z} $.  But subtraction is not closed on the set $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}$ since $1-3=-2$ is not in $\mathbb{N}$.

The following gives the two part procedure for determining if a particular set $S$ is closed under a particular binary operation $\square$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Choose two arbitrary elements for $S$; label them $a,\,b$.
	\item Show that $a\,\square\, b$ is a number of $S$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
The set $E=\{0,2,4,6,\dots\}$ is closed under addition.  Let $a=2m$ and $b=2n$ be arbitary elements of $E$.  Then since $2m+2n=2(m+n)$ is an even integer the sum of $2m$ and $2n$ is in $E$.  $E$ is also closed under multiplication since $(2m)(2n)=4mn=2(2mn)$ is even.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
The set of all rational numbers of the form $ 3^n,n\in \mathbb{Z} $, is closed under multiplication since $ 3^a\cdot 3^b=3^{a+b}. $
\end{tcexample}

	Hint:  Is 3/8 in $I$?  Is 1/9 in $I$?
	\item Are the irrationals closed under multiplication?
	\item Prove that if $S$ and $T$ are sets of integers closed under subtraction so is the intersection $S\cap T$.  Is the union of $S$ and $T$ also closed under subtraction?
	\item Why does 0 always have to be a member of any set that is closed under subtraction?
	\item Let $R$ denote a $120^\circ$ rotation of an equilateral triangle.  Is the set $\{I,R,R^2\}$ closed under ``rotation''?  Here, $I$ means do nothing and $R^2$ means a $240^\circ$ rotation.
	
	\item 
	(a) Express each of $ 5 $ and $ 13 $ as a sum of two squares. Express 65 as a sum of two squares.\\
	(b) Is the set $ A=\{m^2+n^2:m,n\in \mathbb{Z}\} $ closed under ordinary multiplication?
	
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Units Multiplication}
\index{units multiplication}
Under units multiplication the product of any two positive integers, denoted by $a\,\square\, b$, is the units digit of the product under ordinary multiplication.  So $5\,\square\,9=5,\, 7\,\square\,8=6$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[16.] Is the set $\{0,2,4,6,8\}$ closed under units multiplication?
	\item[17.]Is the set $\{1,3,7,9\}$ closed under units multiplication?
	\item[18.]Is $\{1,4,6\}$ closed under units multiplication?  How about the set $\{2,4,8\}$?  How about $\{1,5,9\}$?
	\item[19.]What would you have to add to the set $\{1,3,5\}$ to make it closed under units multiplication?

Closing Comments: As you can see from the problems, the concept of closure is important. Analyzing for closure promotes a deeper understanding of the use of counterexamples. It also facilitates moving from specific examples to general results. \\

\section{Groups}
\stepcounter{section}
 A GROUP is an algebraic structure that consists of two items: a set of elements $G$, and a binary operation $\circ$.  This structure satisfies FOUR axioms:\index{group}\\

\underline{CLOSURE:} For any elements $a$ and $b$ in $G$, $a\,\circ\,b$ is also in $G$.\\

\underline{IDENTITY:} There is a unique element $e$ in $G$ such that for any $a\in G$ we have $a\,\circ\,e=a=e\,\circ\,a$.\\

\underline{INVERSES:} For every element $a$ in $G$ there is an element $a^{-1}$ in $G$ so that $a\,\circ\,a^{-1}=e=a^{-1}\,\circ\,a$\\

\underline{ASSOCIATIVITY:} For any three elements $a, b, c$ in $G$ we have $(a\,\circ\,b)\,\circ\,c=a\,\circ\,(b\,\circ\,c).$\\
A general group can be denoted as $(G,\circ)$ indicating the importance of having both a carrier set $G$ and a binary operation $\circ$.  When the operation is clear from a particular context we may write just $G$ for that group.\index{group axioms}
\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 $(\Z,+)$ is a group under the usual addition operation.  Choose $a,b$ in $\Z$.  Since $a+b$ is an integer CLOSURE holds.  The IDENTITY $e$ is 0 since $0+a=a=a+0$ for any $a\in G$.  The INVERSE of $a$ is $-a$ (we could write $a^{-1}=-a$) since $a+(-a)=0=(-a)+a$.  ASSOCIATIVITY holds since $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 In the exercises you will show that the following are groups: $(\mathbb{Q},+)$, $(\mathbb{R},+)$, $(\mathbb{Q}^+,\times)$, $(\mathbb{R}^+,\times)$ where $\mathbb{Q}$=Rationals, $\mathbb{R}$=Reals, $\mathbb{Q}^+$= Positive Rationals, $\mathbb{R}^+$=Positive Reals.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
In the exercises you will show that the following are \underline{not} groups: $(\Z,-),\,(\Z,\div)$. What do you think goes wrong with the binary operation $ \div $?
\end{tcexample}

\subsection{Abelian Groups}
\rule{0in}{.5in}
Some groups have an additional fifth property called commutativity.  A binary operation $\circ$ on a set $G$ is commutative if $a\,\circ\,b = b\,\circ\,a$ for all $a,b$ in $G$.  We also say that the group $(G,\circ)$ is an ABELIAN GROUP\index{Abelian group}, named after Niels Abel, a major contributor in the development of group theory.  He also proved the insolvability of the fifth-degree polynomial equation, one of his greatest achievements.\\

Caution: The words commutative and abelian are almost synonymous. In doing proofs, one can never say $ ``G $ is abelian since it is commutative". Often commutative describes a binary operation while abelian describes a group. \\

	

The examples involving $\Z,\, \mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ above are all abelian groups.
\newpage
\subsection{Group Tables}

\rule{0in}{.1in}
When the set $G$ is finite (most of the above examples were infinite) the four group properties and be readily detected from an operation table. We saw earlier that the set $G=\{1,3,7,9\}$ was closed under units multiplication denoted $\otimes$.  The operation table follows.
$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\otimes & ~1~& ~3~ & ~7~ & ~9~\\
\hline
1 & 1 & 3 & 7 & 9\\
3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7\\
7 & 7 & 1 & 9 & 3\\
9 & 9 & 7 & 3 & 1
\end{array}$$
The symbol $\otimes$ means take $a$ from the left most column and ``multiply'' by $b$ from the very top row.  The 16 interior elements are just 1, 3, 7 and 9 showing \underline{closure}.  The element 1 acts like the \underline{identity}  -- look at the top interior row and the left most interior column.  \underline{Inverses} are easy to find;  just look for the 1's in the table.  Since $1\,\otimes\, 1=1,\,3\,\otimes\,7=1$ and  $9\,\otimes\,9=1$ we have the following table of inverses.
$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
x & 1 & 3 & 7 & 9\\
\hline
x^{-1} & 1 & 7 & 3 & 9
\end{array}$$
\underline{Associativity} is inherited from multiplication in $\Z$; we now know that $(G,\otimes)$ is a group.  In fact, the symmetry of the table shows that $G$ is an abelian group.\\

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 Here is an example of a group that involves functions and algebra.  The operation is composition of functions.  $ Let  $$f(x)=x$, $g(x)=\frac{1}{1-x}$ and $h(x)=\frac{x-1}{x}$.  $G=\{f,g,h\}$ is a group with identity function $f$.  The ``product'' $gh$ is $g(h(x))=g(\frac{x-1}{x})=\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x-1}{x})}=\frac{x}{x-(x-1)}=x$.  Conclusion: $gh=f$.  You should form the other products and make the group table.
\end{tcexample}

\subsection{Consequences of the 4 Group Axioms}
%
\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
If $ab=ac$ in a group $G$ then $b=c$.  (This is called left cancellation).
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
Multiply each side of $ab=ac$ on the left by $a^{-1}$.  You get $(a^{-1}a)b=(a^{-1}a)c$ or $b=c$.  A similar result holds for right cancellation.  But be careful ``mixed'' cancellation may not work, i.e. $ab=ca$ does not necessarily imply $b=c$.
\end{newproof}

\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
In the multiplication table for a finite group $G=\{g_1,g_2,\dots g_n\}$ each element of $G$ appears exactly once in each row.
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
The entries on row $r$ are $rg_1, rg_2,rg_3,\dots, rg_n.$  If two of these are the same, say $rg_i=rg_j$ then $g_i=g_j$ upon left multiplication by $r^{-1}$.  But this is  a contradiction.  Why?  It can also be shown that elements in any column are distinct.
\end{newproof}

%
\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
	For any $a\in G$, $(a^{-1})^{-1}=a$.
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
$a\,a^{-1} = e$.  This is like saying that the inverse of 2 in $(Q,\times)$ is $2^{-1} =\frac12$ since $2\cdot\frac12=1$, the identity.
\end{newproof}
%
\begin{tctheorem}{Sock-Shoe Theorem}{}\index{Sock-shoe Theorem}
$(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$. 
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
$(ab)(b^{-1}a^{-1})=a(bb^{-1})a^{-1}=aea^{-1}=e$.
\end{newproof}
%
\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
	 If $a=a^{-1}$ for all $a\in G$, then $G$ is abelian.
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
 $ab=a^{-1}b^{-1}=(ba)^{-1}=ba$.  This result is equivalent to saying that if the operation table has $e$, the identity, down the main diagonal then $G$ is abelian.  The reason; $a=a^{-1}$ implies $a^2=e$.
\end{newproof}

%
\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
	Let $a$ and $b$ be in a group $G$. Show that $(ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}$ if and only if $ab=ba$.
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
First we show that if $ (ab)^{-1}=a^{-1}b^{-1} $, then $ ab=ba $. We have $ ab=((ab)^{-1})^{-1}=(a^{-1}b^{-1})^{-1}=(b^{-1})^{-1}(a^{-1})^{-1}=ba $. Conversely, if $ ab=ba $, then $ (ab)^{-1}=(ba)^{-1}=a^{-1}b^{-1} $
\end{newproof}
%
\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
	Prove that $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$ in a group $G$ if and only if $G$ is abelian.
\end{tctheorem}
The proof of Theorem 7 is left as a problem. 

\subsection{A Group Generator}
Sometimes there is an element in a group $G$ whose powers (sums) generate the entire group.  In $G=\{1,3,7,9\}$ under units multiplication, 3 is such an element since $3^0=1, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=7$.  We can write $[3]=\{1,3,7,9\}$ to show that 3 is a \underline{generator}.\index{group generator}  It is also true that $[7]=[3]$, but $[9]\neq\{1,3,7,9\}$.  A group that has a generator is called \underline{cyclic}.\index{cyclic group}  Hence \{1,3,7,9\} is a cyclic group. $\{1,-1,i,-i\}$ is also a cyclic group under complex multiplication, generated by either $i$ or $-i$.  $(\Z,+)$ is an additive cyclic group generated by 1 or $-1$.  For an additive group, powers are replaced by sums: $2=1+1, 3=1+1+1, 4=1+1+1+1, \dots$ and so on.  In summary, for a group whose operation is multiplication $a^m$ means $a\cdot a \cdot a\cdot\dots\cdot a$; if the operation is addition, $m\cdot a$ means $a+a+a+\dots+a$.\\
Here is a chart showing a comparison between the two notations:\\

\subsection{Subgroups}
\index{subgroup}
Let $(G,\circ)$ be a group and let $H$ be a \underline{subset} of the set $G$.  $(H,\circ)$ is a subgroup of $(G,\circ)$ if $(H,\circ)$ is closed under $\circ$, has the $e$ of $G$ as the identity and contains inverses.  Associativity is inherited from $(G,\circ)$.  Examples are easy to find. $(\Z,+)$ is a subgroup of $(Q,+)$.  \{1,9\} is a subgroup of \{1,3,7,9\} under mod 10 multiplication.  The set $\{1,-1\}$ is a subgroup of $\{1,-1,i,-i\}$ which itself is a subgroup of all complex numbers under multiplication.  The set of all integral multiples of 3, $H=\{0,\pm3,\pm6,\dots\}$, is a subgroup of $(\Z,+)$.  Can you give a subset $S$ of $(\Z,+)$ such that $S$ is closed under addition but is not a subgroup?
\subsection{Modular Groups}
\index{modular groups}
Clock arithmetic provides a fruitful source of nice finite groups.  Recalling that 13 o'clock is really just 1 o'clock upon subtraction of 12, we can make a clock with just the four numbers 0,1,2,3 the remainders when any integer $n$ is divided by 4. We can write $7\equiv3(\text{mod }4)$ for example.  This is read as 7 is congruent to 3 modulo 4.  In general $a\equiv b(\text{mod }m)$ means that $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $m$; or that $a-b$ is divisible by $m$.\\[.2in]
%
\underline{Definition.}  Let $\Z_n=\{0,1,2,3,\dots, n-1\}$.  The \underline{sum $a+b$} \index{sum} of any two elements in $\Z_n$ is just the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by $n$. \\[.2in]
 With this definition of sum we can see that $(\Z_n,+)$ is a group.  Lets form the operation table for $\Z_4=\{0,1,2,3\}$.
$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
+ & 0 & 1& 2 & 3\\
\hline
~0~ & ~0~ & ~1~ & ~2~ & ~3~\\
1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0\\
2 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 1\\
3 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 2
\end{array}$$

The table shows closure, and that 0 is the identity.  Locate the 0's in the table to see that the inverse of 0 is 0, the inverse of 1 is 3 (since 1+3=0), the inverse of 2 is 2, and the inverse of 3 is 1.  This new sum rule is an associative binary operation on $\Z_4$ since ordinary addition is associative on $\Z$, the usual integers.  In similar analysis, $(\Z_n,+)$ is an additive group.\\

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
$\Z_6 = \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$ is a group with a number of subgroups.  $A=\{0\},\, B=\{0,3\},\, C=\{0,2,4\}$, and $D=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$ are all subgroups of $\Z_6$.  The following picture, called a lattice of subgroups,\index{lattice of subgroups} shows the relationships between the subgroups.
\centerline{\input{drawing1.pdf_tex}}
The upward sloping lines indicate subgroup inclusion: $A\subseteq B, A\subseteq C, B\subseteq D, C\subseteq D$ and $A\subseteq B\subseteq D, A\subseteq C\subseteq D$, two chains of length two.
\end{tcexample}
\newpage
\begin{tcexample}{}{}
The modular groups $\Z_n$ are cyclic where 1 is always a generator for the additive groups $ \Z_n $.\\
For $\Z_4$, 1 is a generator since
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
1\cdot 1&= 1=1\\
2\cdot 1 &=1+1=2\\
3\cdot 1 &=1+1+1 = 3\\
4\cdot 1 &=1+1+1+1 =4
\end{split}\end{equation*}
In additive notation $3\cdot 1$ means add three 1's together.  In $\Z_6$, only 1 and 5 are generators.  For example, 3 is not a generator since you can only make 0 and 3 using multiples $m\cdot3$ of 3.  Try it!  Likewise, the element 2 will only generate 0, 2, 4.  
\end{tcexample}
The previous example prompts the question: which elements in $\Z_n$ are generators?  The following chart might provide a clue as you pursue the question in the exercises.
$$\begin{array}{|lll|}
\hline
n \qquad& \Z_n & \text{generators}\\
\hline
2 & \{0,1\} & 1\\
\hline
3 & \{0,1,2\}  & 1,2\\
\hline
4 & \{0,1,2,3\} & 1,3\\
\hline
5 & \{0,1,2,3,4\} & 1,2,3,4\\
\hline
6 & \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}\qquad & 1, 5\\

\section{More on Cyclic Groups}
\stepcounter{section}
Recall that if a group $ G $ is made up entirely of powers of a particular element, call it $ a $, then $ G $ is called a \underline{cyclic group}\index{cyclic group} denoted by $ G=[a] $. The element $ a $ is called a \underline{generator},\index{group generator} and the least positive integer $ s $ such that $ a^s=e $, the identity in $ G$, is called the \underline{order} \index{order of an element}of $ a $. $ G $ can be finite or infinite.

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
The additive group $Z$ is cyclic. Either 1 or $-1$ will generate all of $\Z$. Since $ \Z $ is additive, $ [-1]=\{m\cdot (-1): m\in \Z \} $; so $ [-1] $ consists of all distinct elements among the ``additive powers" \dots, $ -3(-1),-2(-1),-1(-1),0,-1,-2,-3\dots. $
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	 $ 5\Z=[5]=\{0,\pm5,\pm10\dots \} $ is a cyclic subgroup of $ \Z $ generated by $ 5 $ (or $ -5 $). The generator 5 has infinite order.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	The order of $ i $ in $ [i]=\{1,-1,i,-i\} $ is 4, while $ -1 $ has order 2.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
$ \Z_n=\{0,1,2,\dots, n-1\} $ is cyclic for all positive $ n $.\\
$ \Z_{12} $ has $1, 5, 7, \text{and } 11$ as generators. Lets check 5:\\
$ 0\cdot5=0 $\hspace{1cm}$ 6\cdot 5=6 $\\
$ 1\cdot5=5 $\hspace{1cm}$7\cdot 5=11 $\\
$ 2\cdot5=10$\hspace{.8cm}$8\cdot 5=4 $\\
$ 3\cdot5=3 $\hspace{1cm}$ 9\cdot 5=9 $\\
$ 4\cdot5=8 $\hspace{1cm}$ 10\cdot 5=2 $\\
$ 5\cdot5=1 $\hspace{1cm}$ 11\cdot 5=7 $\\
You might want to check that $ 7 $ also generates $ \Z_{12} $. We can write $ \Z_{12}=[1]=[5]=[7]=[11] $. Finally, since the $ \gcd(3,12)=3 $, the element $ 3 $ generates a subgroup of $ \frac{12}{3}=4 $ elements; $ [3]=\{0,3,6,9\} $
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 Let $ G=[a] $ be a cyclic group  of order 12. Then with $ a^{12}=e,$\\$[a]=\{e,a,a^2,a^3,\dots,a^{11}\}. $ The generator $ a $ has order 12; the element $ a^7 $ is also a generator. The order of $ a^3 $ is 4 since 4 is the least power $ s $ such that $ (a^3)^s=e $.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
Let $ G=[a] $ be a cyclic group of order 30. The order of $ a^9 $ is 10 and $ [a^9]=\{e,a^9,a^{18},a^{27},a^6,a^{15},a^{24},a^3,a^{12},a^{21}\}. $The elements are listed in the order that they are made.
\end{tcexample}

The following are two useful results:\\
\underline{Result 1.} Let $ a\in \Z_n. $ $ [a]=\Z_n $ if and only if $ a $ and $ n $ are relatively prime, i.e.\, $ \gcd(a,n)=1 $.\index{relatively prime} \\[.2in]
\underline{Result 2.} Let $ G =[a]$ have order $ n $. Then $ G=[a^m] $ if and only if $ \gcd(m,n)=1 $.\\
\subsection{Multiplicative Group of Invertibles}
\quad Let $ V_n $ denote the subset of the additive group $ \Z_n=\{0,1,2,\dots,n-1\} $ of subsets that have \underline{multiplicative} inverses.\index{invertible} Alternatively, we could define $ V_n $ as the set of all positive integers less than $ n $ that are relatively prime to $ n $. $ V_n $ is a group under multiplication modulo $ n $. Showing inverses is the only interesting aspect. If $ \gcd(m,n)=1=am+bn $, for some integers $ a $ and $ b $, then $ m $ has an inverse $ a $ since $ bn\equiv o(n) $, leaving $ am\equiv 1(n) $.\\

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
$ V_8 = \{1,3,5,7\}$. The multiplicative identity is 1 and each of $ 3,5,7 $ is its own inverse. $ V_8 $ is not cyclic.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	  Each of $ V_5,V_6,V_7 $ is cyclic but $ V_{16} $ is not. The orders of the elements in $ V_{16}=\{1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15\} $ are $ 1,4,4,2,2,4,4,2 $, respectively. Lacking an element of order 8, $ V_{16} $ cannot be cyclic.

\subsection{Wilson's Theorem}
\stepcounter{section}
\quad The multiplicative group $ V_n $ provides us with a structure that yields a proof of an interesting number theoretic result - WILSON'S THEOREM. John Wilson(1741-1793) is usually credited with the theorem, although many feel that some credit belongs to Lagrange.

\begin{tctheorem}{Wilson's Theorem}{}
	Let $ p\neq2 $ be a positive prime. Then $ (p-1)!\equiv -1(\text{mod } p). $ Here is an alternate statement: the product of all the nonzero elements in $ \Z_p $ is $ -1 $. Or: The product of all the elements in $ V_p=\{1,2,3,\dots , p-1\} $ is $ -1 $.\index{Wilson's Theorem}
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
In $ V_p $ the product $2\cdot 3 \cdot$ \dots $\cdot p-2  $ is congruent to $ 1 \text{ mod } p $. $ V_p $ has an even number of elements $ x $ such that $ x\neq x^{-1} $. Now use $ p-1\equiv -1(p) .$
\end{newproof}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
Let $ p=11; V_{11}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}.$ Nearly all of these elements pair up with their inverses: $ 2\cdot 6\equiv 3\cdot 4 \equiv 5\cdot 9 \equiv 7 \cdot 8 \equiv 1 $, leaving $ 1\cdot 10 \equiv -1 $.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 Let $ p=13; V_{13}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12\} $. Here, the product $ 2\cdot 3\cdot 4 \cdot$ \dots $ \cdot 11 $  of 10 numbers is congruent to 1, due to the pairing of each $ x $ with $ x^{-1} $. This leaves $ 12\equiv -1(13) $.\\[.2in]

\section{Lagrange's Theorem}
\stepcounter{section}
\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
Let $G$ be a finite group.  The order of any subgroup $H$ divides the order of $G$.
\end{tctheorem}\index{Lagrange's Theorem}
%
This will be seen by partitioning the elements of $G$ into non overlapping sets called \underline{cosets},\index{coset} as illustrated in the following.\\[.2in]
\underline{Definition.} Choose an element $a$ in $G$.  A (left) coset of $H$ is the set $aH$ consisting of all products $ah$ with $h\in H$. The set $ Ha $ is a right coset.\\[.2in]
Let $H=\{1,14\}$ be a subgroup of the group of invertibles $V_{15}=\{1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14\}$.\\
In this example, $1H=\{1,14\},\,2H=\{2,13\},\,4H=\{4,11\},\,7H=\{7,8\}$.\\
The order of $H=2=\text{order} \, G/$\# of cosets.  The number of cosets is called the \underline{index} of $H$ in $G$.

In general, $H=\{h_1, h_2, \dots, h_r\},\,aH=\{ah_1, ah_2,\dots,ah_r\}$.  Cosets have two important properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The elements of $aH$ are distinct.  If $ah_i=ah_j$, left cancellation will produce a contradiction.
\item Distinct left cosets are disjoint -- not too hard to prove.  Just assume some element is in both $aH$ and $bH$ and see what happens.
\end{enumerate}
Now let order $G=s$ and order $H=r$.  Start making all (left) cosets until you exhaust all elements of $G$.
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
aH&=\{ah_1,ah_2,ah_3,\dots,ah_r\}\\
bH&=\{bh_1,bh_2,bh_3,\dots,bh_r\}\\
&\qquad\vdots
\end{split}\end{equation*}
Here we take a new $ b\in G $ (but $ b\notin aH $), and continue this process until all elements in $ G $ have been accounted for. 
There can only be a finite number of these cosets, say $t$.  Then $rt=s$.  This completes the proof of Lagrange's Theorem, since $ r $ divides $ s $.

Here is an example of an additive group where $o(G)$=12, $o(H)$=4 and the index $t=3$.  Let $G=\Z_{12}=\{0,1,2,\dots,11\}$ and $H=\{0,3,6,9\}$.  The three cosets are
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
0+H &= \{0,3,6,9\}\\
1+H&=\{1,4,7,10\}\\
2+H&=\{2,5,8,11\}
\end{split}\end{equation*}
Verify properties 1 and 2 above, and that every element $\Z_{12}$ is in precisely one coset.

As a corollary to Lagrange's Theorem, we have that the order of every element in a finite group must divide $o(G)$.\\

As a final comment, Lagrange's Theorem tells us that there are really only two ``different" groups of order 4, for example. If $ o(G)=4 $, then either $ G $ is cyclic or not. If $ G $ is cyclic, $ G=[a] $ where $ a $ has order 4. If $ G $ is not cyclic then all elements (except $ e $) must have order $ 2 $ by Lagrange's Theorem. This latter group is called a \underline{Klein 4-group} (The penny group is a Klein 4-group).\index{Klein 4-group}\\[.2in]
\underline{PROBLEMS - LAGRANGE'S THEOREM}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find all the (left) cosets of $H=\{0,6\} $ in $\Z_{12}$.
\item Find all the cosets of $H=\{0,4,8\}$ in $\Z_{12}$.
\item Find all cosets of $H=\{1,8\}$ in $V_9$.  Does $V_9$ have any other subgroups?
\item Find all cosets of $H=\{1,4\}$ in $V_{15}$.  Repeat with $H=\{1,4,11,14\}$.
\item Prove that every group having prime order must be cyclic.
\item Show that a cyclic group of order 22 has one element of order 2 and ten elements of order 11.
\item Let $ G $ be a group of order 45. What are the possible subgroup orders?
\item Prove that a group $ G $ of order 49 must have a subgroup of order 7. Hint: consider two cases:$ G $ is either cyclic or not. 
\item Let $G=[a]$ be a cyclic group of order 91.  Find a subgroup having index 13.
\item Let $ K $ be a subgroup of $ H $, and let $ H $ be a subgroup of a group $ G $. If the order of $ K $ is 6 and the order of $ G $ is 144, what are the possibilities for the order of $ H $?
\end{enumerate}

Here are two important consequences of Lagrange's theorem.\\[.2in]
\begin{tctheorem}{Fermat's Theorem}{}\index{Fermat's Theorem}
If $ a $ is an integer and $ p $ is a prime, then $ a^p \equiv a(\text{mod } p) $.
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
Take a look at $ V_p=\{1,2,\text{\dots},p-1\} $, the multiplicative group of integers $ \text{mod } p. $ The order of $ V_p $ is $ p-1 $. It then follows that $ a^{p-1}\equiv 1 (\text{mod } p) $. Now, multiply by $a$. (The following more general result holds as a consequence of Lagrange's theorem: if $ n $ is the order of a group $ G $ and $ a\in G $, then $ a^n=e $).
\end{newproof}
Fermat's theorem extends to the following more general result.\\[.2in] 
\underline{Definition.} The Euler $ \varphi $-function. Let $ m\in \Z^+ $, then $ \varphi(m) $ denotes the number of integers $ a $ in $\{0,1,2,\dots,  m-1 \}$ such that $ \gcd(a,m)=1. $\index{Euler $ \varphi- $ function}\\[.2in]
As an example $ \varphi(10)=4 $ since the integers $ 1,3,7,9 $ are each relatively prime to 10. $ \varphi(11)=10 $ since 11 is prime.\\[.2in]
\begin{tctheorem}{Euler's Theorem}{}\index{Euler's Theorem}
If $ \gcd(a,m)=1 $, then $ a^{\varphi(m)}\equiv 1\pmod m $.
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
The order of $ V_m $ is $ \varphi(m) $. It then follows from Lagrange's theorem that
$$a^{\varphi(m)}\equiv1\pmod m $$
As an example, take $ m=10 $ and $ a=3 $. First, $ \gcd(10,3)=1 $, and $ \varphi(10)=4 $. So $ 3^4\equiv 1(10). $
\end{newproof}

\section{Group Isomorphisms}
\stepcounter{section}
The set of rational numbers is denoted by $Q=\{\frac{a}{b}:b\neq0, a,b \in \Z\}$.  The special subset of $Q$ where $b=1$ is essentially like $\Z=\{0,\pm1,\pm2, \dots\}$.  For all practical purposes, these two sets are the same.  This similarity is addressed in the mathematical language that follows:

\underline{Definition.} An ISOMORPHISM \index{isomorphism} between two groups $(G,\circ)$ and $(G',\square)$ is a mapping $\theta:G\mapsto G'$ such that\\
(a) $\theta$ is one-to-one\\
(b) $\theta$ is onto\\
(c) $\theta(a\circ b)=\theta(a)\square\theta(b)$\quad($\theta$ preserves the operation).\index{preservation of operation}\\
For property (c) the operation $a\circ b$ takes place in $G$, while $\theta(a)\square\theta(b)$ occurs in the image group $G'$.  This same concept is seen in calculus when we write $\lim(f(x)\cdot g(x)) = \lim f(x)\cdot \lim g(x)$ or $(f+g)'=f'+g'$ for derivatives.  It is much more notorious when seen as the students' dream: $(x+y)^2=x^2+y^2$ or $\log xy =(\log x)(\log y)$.

Here are several examples.
\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	 Let $\mathbb{Q}^*=\{\frac{a}{1}:a\in \Z\}$.  Then $\mathbb{Q}^*$ is isomorphic to $\Z$ under the isomorphism $\theta(\frac{a}{1})=a$.  $\theta$ is $1-1$, onto and $\theta(\frac{a}{1}+\frac{b}{1})=\frac{a+b}{1}=a+b=\theta(\frac{a}{1})+\theta(\frac{b}{1})$.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	$\mathbb{Q}^{**}=\{\frac{a}{2}:a\in \Z\}$ is isomorphic to $\Z$.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	The group $A=\{1,-1,i,-i\}$ under complex multiplication is isomorphic to the cyclic group $B=\{e,a,a^2,a^3\} $ under the following mapping:
	$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
	x&1&-1&i&-i\\
	\hline
	\theta(x)&e&a^2&a&a^3
	\end{array}$$
	$\theta$ is evidently 1-1 and onto.  Here, $\theta(ab)=\theta(a)\theta(b)$ can be checked for each pair $a,b$.  For example, $\theta[i(-i)]=\theta[1]=e$ and $\theta(i)\cdot\theta(-i)=a\cdot a^3=e$.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 Let $G=(\mathbb{R},+)$, the real numbers under addition, and $G'=(\mathbb{R}^+,\times)$, the positive reals under multiplication.  The mapping $\theta(x)=2^x$ is an isomorphism from $G$ onto $G'$.  Properties of logarithms show 1-1 and onto.  $\theta(a+b)=\theta(a)\cdot\theta(b)$ follows from $\theta(a+b)=2^{a+b}=2^a\cdot2^b = \theta(a)\theta(b)$.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 Again, let $G=(\mathbb{R},+)$. The mapping $\theta:G\rightarrow G$ (itself) given by $\theta(x)=x^2$ is not an isomorphism.

\item Can you give an isomorphism from $G'=(\mathbb{R}^+,\times)$ onto $G=(\mathbb{R},+)$?
\item If group $A$ is isomorphic to the group $B$, and if $A$ is abelian, prove that $B$ is abelian.
\item If $\theta:G\mapsto G'$ is an isomorphism and $e$ is the identity of $G$ and $e'$ is the identity in $G'$, then $\theta(e)=e'$ and $\theta(x^{-1})=[\theta(x)]^{-1}$.
\item Let $\theta$ be a group isomorphism from $G$ to $G'$, show that if $\theta(a)=a'$ then $\theta(a^n)=(a')^n$.
\item Show that if $\theta(a)=a'$ under a group isomorphism then $a$ and $a'$ have the same order.
\item Prove that $V_{10}$ is isomorphic to $V_5$, ie, that the set of invertibles in $\Z_{10}$ is isomorphic to the invertibles in $\Z_5$.
\item Let $\theta:(\mathbb{R}^+,\times)\mapsto(\mathbb{R}^+,\times)$ be defined by $\theta(x)=\sqrt x$.  Is $\theta$ an isomorphism from $(\mathbb{R}^+,\times)$ to itself?
\item Show that $V_8$ is not isomorphic to $V_{10}$.  Hint: Make a table of orders.
\item Show that $V_8$ is isomorphic to $V_{12}$.
\item Let $G=\{0,\pm3,\pm6, \pm9,\dots\}$ and $H=\{0,\pm7,\pm14,\pm21,\dots\}$.  Are $G$ and $H$ isomorphic under addition?  If yes, does that isomorphism preserve multiplication?


From certain of these exercises you can see that essential group properties are preserved under group isomorphisms.  We say that these properties are \underline{invariant}\index{invariant} under isomorphisms. \\[.1in]
HOW TO PROVE THAT TWO GROUPS ARE ISOMORPHIC:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First produce a mapping $\theta$.
\item Check that it is 1-1 and onto.
\item Verify that $\theta(a\circ b)=\theta(a)\square \theta(b)$.
\end{enumerate}
~\\[.2in]
HOW TO PROVE THAT TWO GROUPS $G$ AND $G'$ ARE\\ \underline{NOT} ISOMORPHIC:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $G$ and $G'$ do not have the same order.
\item Show that one is abelian, the other not.
\item Look at the order of elements of each and note discrepancy.
\item Show that one is cyclic, the other not.
\item In general, look at invariants and see if something is not consistent.
\end{enumerate}

Be careful on what you determine to be structural, ie, like the properties just seen in (a) - (e).  For example, you cannot say that $\Z$ and $5\Z$ under addition are not isomorphic because 13 is in $\Z$ but not in $5\Z$.  That is not a structural property.

\item Prove that $ (\mathbb{R}^*,\times) $, the multiplicative group of nonzero real numbers is \underline{NOT} isomorphic to  $ (\mathbb{R}^+,\times) $, the positive reals under multiplication. Hint: look for an element of order 2 in each.
\item Prove that $ (\Z,+) $ is not isomorphic to $ (\mathbb{Q},+) $.
\item Is $ (\mathbb{Q},+) $ isomorphic to $ (\mathbb{Q}^*,\times) $, where $ \mathbb{Q}^* $ is the set of all \underline{nonzero} rationals? Hint: Assume that there is an isomorphism $ \theta: \mathbb{Q}\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^* $.

\section{Direct Products}
\stepcounter{section}
Known groups can be building blocks for forming new groups.  If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are groups then the cartesian product $G_1 \times G_2$ is a group under the operation $(a,b)\,\circ\,(c,d)=(ac,bd)$ and is called the DIRECT PRODUCT\index{Direct Product}.  The identity is $(e_1,e_2)$ and the inverse of $(a,b)$ is $(a^{-1},b^{-1})$ since $(a,b)\,\circ\,(a^{-1},b^{-1})=(e_1,e_2)$.  Closure and associativity are easy to see.

Sometimes the operation is viewed as additive.  For example, $\Z_2\times \Z_3$ is an additive group.  It has the six elements: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).  the element (1, 1) is a generator: $2(1, 1) = (1, 1)+(1, 1)= (0, 2)$, and so on.
\begin{tctheorem}{}{}

\section{Permutation Groups}\index{permutation group}
\stepcounter{section}
 Each permutation of $ 1,2,3,4 $ is a one-to-one, onto function and can be viewed in several ways:

\underline{Table:}~ \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
	
	x & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
	\hline
	$ f(x) $ & 2 & 4 & 3 & 1 \\
\end{tabular}
\quad\quad \underline{Arrow:}~ $ 1\rightarrow2,2\rightarrow4,3\rightarrow3,4\rightarrow1 $\\

\underline{Matrix:}~ $\begin{pmatrix}

	2 & 4 & 3 & 1 
\end{pmatrix}$ \hspace{2cm} \underline{Cycle:}~ (124); $ 1\rightarrow2\rightarrow4\rightarrow1\rightarrow 2 $\dots\\

With \underline{composition} of functions as ``multiplication", a group structure can be formed. For example, if $ \alpha=\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3  \\
1 & 3 & 2  
\end{pmatrix}  $ and $ \beta= \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3  \\
3 & 1 & 2  
\end{pmatrix} $ the product $ \alpha\beta $ becomes $ \alpha\beta= \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3  \\
1 & 3 & 2  
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3  \\
3 & 1 & 2  
\end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3  \\
3& 2 & 1  
\end{pmatrix}=(13)$, using both matrix and cycle forms.\index{cycle notation} Also, $ \beta\alpha=\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3  \\
2 & 1 & 3  
\end{pmatrix}=(12) $, so composition of permutations is not commutative.\\

The set of all permutations on $ X_n=\{1,2,\text{\dots},n\} $ is denoted by $ S_n $.\\[.2in]
\underline{Definition.} $ S_n $ is called the \underline{SYMMETRIC GROUP} \index{symmetric group} on $ X_n=\{1,2,3,\text{\dots}, n\} $.

\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
$ S_n $ is a group under composition of permutations.
\end{tctheorem}
\begin{newproof}
To simplify notation and computation let's use $ n=3,4,5,6 $ for illustration purposes. The leap to general $ n $ just requires \dots in most cases.\\
Identity: $ e=\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 &  4\\
1 & 2 & 3 & 4
\end{pmatrix} $ is easy to verify.\\
Inverses: The inverse of $ \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 &  4\\
a & b & c & d
\end{pmatrix} $ ~is~ $ \begin{pmatrix} 
a & b & c &  d\\
1 & 2 & 3 & 4
\end{pmatrix} $ ~since~ $\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 &  4\\
a & b & c & d
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
a& b & c &  d\\
1 & 2 & 3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}=e$.\\
Closure: The composition of two permutations is another permutation.\\
Associativity: Easy to show.
\end{newproof}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 $ \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 &  4\\
3 & 1 & 2 & 4
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix} 
3 & 1 & 4 &  2\\
1 & 2 & 3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 &  4\\
2 & 4 & 1 & 3
\end{pmatrix} $. Moving columns around doesn't change the function.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
The permutation $ \alpha= \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 &  4 & 5 & 6\\
6 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 5 & 3
\end{pmatrix} $ could be expressed in cycle form as $ \alpha=(163)(24)(5) $. Note here that $ (163)=(631)=(316),(24)=(42) $, and $ (5) $ means leave 5 fixed, so we don't need to write it. Also, always start any cycle with the smallest integer - so we don't need $ (631) $ or $ (316) $. Just use $ (163) $.
\end{tcexample}


\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	What is the order of $ \alpha=(163)(24)$ in $ S_6 $?\\
	The reader should verify the following computations:\\
	$ \alpha^2=(163)(24)(163)(24)=(136) $\\
	$ \alpha^3=\alpha^2\alpha=(136)(163)(24)=(24) $\\
	$ \alpha^4=\alpha^2\alpha^2=(163) $\\
	$ \alpha^5=\alpha^2\alpha^3=(136)(24)= $ well, we are nearly done. Notice that disjoint cycles commute.\\
	$ \alpha^6=\alpha^3\cdot\alpha^3=(24)(24)=(1) $\\
	So the order of $ \alpha=(163)(24)=6=\text{lcm}(2,3) $.\\
	
	The ``leap frog" technique is useful in computing powers of cycles. Let $ \alpha=(14253) $.\\
	$ \alpha^2=$\.{1} 4 \.{2} 5 \.{3} 1 \.{4} 2 \.{5} 3 \.{1} 4 \.{2} 5 \.{3}\dots$ =(12345) $\\
	$ \alpha^3=$\.{1} 4 2 \.{5} 3 1 \.{4} 2 5 \.{3} 1 4 \.{2} 5 3 \.{1} 4 2 \.{5} 3\dots$ =(15432). $
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
The order of $ (132) $ is 3, but the order of $ (123)(132) $ is 1 since $ (123)(132)=(1)(2)(3) $.

\section{Groups of Symmetries}
\stepcounter{section}
\subsection{Symmetries of an Equilateral Triangle}\index{symmetries of an equilateral triangle}
Our goal here is to study such symmetries and to see how we can create group structures. Introduction of good notation will help. We start with the six symmetries of an equilateral triangle. \\

Lets take the following as our initial position, the identity, or ``do nothing".\\[.01in]


\begin{tikzpicture}
\hspace{2.25in}
\foreach \a in {1}{
	
	\node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=2.5cm, draw] at (\a*2,0) {};
	\node (v1) at (2,.85) {1};
	\node (v2) at (2.75,-.4) {2};
	\node (v3) at (1.25,-.4) {3};
	
}
\end{tikzpicture}

Let $ r $ denote a clockwise rotation through $ 120\degree $, and so $ r^2 $ will be a $ 240\degree $ rotation:

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth]
\foreach \a in {1,2,3,4}{
	
	\node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=2.5cm, draw] at (\a*4-2.5,0) {};
	\node (v1) at (1.5,.85) {1};
	\node (v2) at (.8,-.4) {3};
	\node (v3) at (2.2,-.4) {2};
	\node (v4) at (5.5,.85) {3};
	\node (v5) at (4.8,-.4) {2};
	\node (v3) at (6.2,-.4) {1};
	\node (v6) at (9.5,.85) {2};
	\node (v7) at (8.8,-.4) {1};
	\node (v8) at (10.2,-.4) {3};
	\node (v9) at (13.5,.85) {1};
	\node (v10) at (12.8,-.4) {3};
	\node (v11) at (14.2,-.4) {2};
	
	\node (v12) at (3.5,.6) {$ r $};
	\node (v13) at (7.5,.6) {$ r $};
	\node (v14) at (11.5,.6) {$ r $};
	
	\draw[->,thick] (2.25,.4) -- (4.75,.4);
	\draw[->,thick] (6.25,.4) -- (8.75,.4);
	\draw[->,thick] (10.25,.4) -- (12.75,.4);
}
\end{tikzpicture}
Applying $ r $ a third time will bring us back to our starting position, or $ r^3=1 $. $ H=\{1,r,r^2\} $ is a nice subgroup.\\

Now do a flip,$ f $, about the altitude holding vertex $ 1 $ fixed. This looks like:

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=stealth]
\hspace{.25in}
\foreach \a in {1,2}{
	
	\node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, minimum size=2.5cm, draw] at (\a*4+1.5,0) {};
	\node (v1) at (1.5,.85) {};
	\node (v2) at (.8,-.4) {};
	\node (v3) at (2.2,-.4) {};
	\node (v4) at (5.5,.85) {1};
	\node (v5) at (4.8,-.4) {3};
	\node (v3) at (6.2,-.4) {2};
	\node (v6) at (9.5,.85) {1};
	\node (v7) at (8.8,-.4) {2};
	\node (v8) at (10.2,-.4) {3};
	\node (v9) at (13.5,.85) {};
	\node (v10) at (12.8,-.4) {};
	\node (v11) at (14.2,-.4) {};
	
	\node (v12) at (3.5,.6) {};
	\node (v13) at (7.5,.65) {$ f $};
	\node (v14) at (11.5,.6) {};
	

	\draw[->,thick] (6.25,.4) -- (8.75,.4);

}
\end{tikzpicture}

The reader should check that $ r^2f $ ($ r^2 $ followed by $ f $, in that order) will yield another flip, one that pivots about vertex 3. The last symmetry, another flip, is given by $ rf $ which is a pivot about vertex 2.\clearpage
Summary: The six symmetries of an equilateral triangle can be expressed in terms of just $ r $ and $ f $. They are, $ \{1,r,r^2,f,rf,r^2f\} $.\\
In the problems you are asked to make the $ 6\times 6 $ operation table for these six symmetries. As you try to complete the table you may run into trouble with a few like $ fr, fr^2, frf $\dots\\

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
In the problems you are asked to draw a sequence of triangles to show $ fr=r^2f. $
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	$ fr^2=(fr)r=(r^2f)r=r^2r^2f=rf $
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
$ frf=(fr)f=r^2ff=r^2 $.
\end{tcexample}

There is something convenient about switching to cycle notation. Notice that $ r=(132) $ and $ f=(23) $. It is not hard to see that $ r^2=(123) $ and $ rf=(13) $, $ r^2f=(12) $. Now we can be independent of the pictures, and generalizations are easier to see.\\
BIG CAUTION! Rotate the pictures clockwise, but perform composition of functions (cycles) \underline{right} to \underline{left} just as you do when computing $ f(g(x)) $. Now cycle form corresponds with the $ r-f $ version.

The interior numbers indicate their movement from $ I $, the original position. The group table for $ G=\{I,H,V,R\} $ is shown next:
 \[
\begin{tabular}{>{$}l<{$}|*{4}{>{$}l<{$}}}
\circ   & ~I~  & ~H~   & ~V~ & ~R~      \\
\hline\vrule height 12pt width 0pt

R   & R  & V  & H & ~I      \\

\] 
$ G $ is evidently a Klein 4-group; the orders of $ H,V, \text{ and }R $ are 2.

\subsection{Cosets and Normal Subgroups}

Lagrange's Theorem states that the order of any subgroup $H$ divides the order of a (finite) group $G$. This is (was) proved by partitioning the elements of $G$
into nonoverlaping sets called \underline {cosets}.\index{coset} For $a\in G$ a (left) coset of $H$ is the set $\{aH\}$ consisting of all products $ah$ with $h\in H$. The number of cosets is called the \underline{index} of $H$ in $G$. A right coset is the set $\{Ha: a\in G\}$. If $aH = Ha$ for every $a\in G$, as sets, we say that $H$ is a \underline{normal} subgroup.\index{normal subgroup}  For an additive group, the notation $a+H = H+a$ is used.

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
Let $S_3 =\{1, r, r^2, f, rf, r^2f\}$ be the rigid transformations of an equilateral triangle. $H = \{1, f\}$ is not a normal subgroup: $rH = \{r, rf\}$, but $Hr = \{r, fr\}$ = $\{r, r^2f\}$. As sets, $rH \neq Hr$.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
	$H = \{1, r, r^2\}$   is a normal subgroup of $G=S_3$. $aH = Ha$ if $a\in H$. So now try the other three: $fH = \{f, r^2f, rf\}$ = $Hf$, $rfH = \{rf, f, r^2f\} = Hrf$, and also $r^2fH = Hr^2f$. So $aH = Ha$, for all $a\in G$.
\end{tcexample}

The good news is that if $G$ is abelian, all subgroups are normal. Here is another helpful result: If the index\index{index of a subgroup} of $H$ in $G$ is $2$, $H$ is normal. That's why it is easy to see that the $H$ in example $2$ is normal.

It turns out that if $H$ is normal you can multiply cosets! You get the following nice process: $aHbH = abH$. This is not hard to show: $abH\subseteq aHbH$ is easy to show. For $aHbH\subseteq abH$, use normality.

\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. The product  $aNbN$ of cosets is the coset $abN$.
\end{tctheorem}

\begin{tctheorem}{}{}
 The (left) cosets of a normal subgroup $H$ in $G$ form a group.
\end{tctheorem}

\begin{newproof}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	
	Closure: $aHbH$ = $abH$
	\item
	
	Identity: If $e$ is the identity in $G$, $eH$ is the identity in the new group since $eHaH$ = $eaH$ = $aH$ = $H$ = $aeH$ = $aH eH$.
	\item
	
	Inverses: The inverse of $aH$ is $a^{-1}H$ since $aHa^{-1}H$ = $a^{-1}aH$ = $H$ = $a^{-1}HaH$.
	\item
	
	Associativity: $aH(bHcH)$ = $aHbcH$ = $abcH$, and ($aHbH)cH$ = $abHcH$ = $abcH$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{newproof}


~\\
\underline{Definition.} If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, the set of all left cosets $aN$ form a group called the \underline{QUOTIENT GROUP},\index{quotient group} or Factor Group,\index{factor group} denoted $G/N$.\\[.2in]

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 Let $G$ = $\Z_6$ and $H$ = $\{0,3\}$. Since $\Z_6$ is abelian, $H$ is a normal subgroup. The three cosets are $H$, $1+H$ = $\{1,4\}$ and $2+H$ = $\{2,5\}$ and $G/H$ = $\{H, 1+H, 2+H\}$.
We next make the addition table for $\Z_6$, with the elements rearranged as $0, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5$; next to it  make the operation table for $G/H$:



\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c||cc|cc|cc}
		$\oplus$ & 0 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 2 & 5 \\ \hline\hline
		0 & 0 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 2 & 5 \\
		3 & 3 & 0 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 2 \\ \hline
		1 & 1 & 4 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 0 \\
		4 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 2 & 0 & 3 \\ \hline
		2 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 0 & 4 & 1 \\
		5 & 5 & 2 & 0 & 3 & 1 & 4
	\end{tabular}
	\qquad\qquad
	\begin{tabular}{c | c c c}
		& $H$ & $1+H$ & $2+H$ \\ \hline
		$H$ & $H$ & $1+H$ & $2+H$ \\
		$1+H$ & $1+H$ & $2+H$ & $H$ \\
		$2+H$ & $2+H$ & $H$ & $1+H$
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
~\\[.1in]

These two tables look almost the same!

There are several features of this example to notice:
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item
	The three cosets partition the elements of $\Z_6$ into three disjoint sets.
	\item
	$H$ = $\{0,3\}$ is the identity coset.
	
	\item
	Some funny addition is going on: $(1+H)$ + $(2+H)$ = $\{1,4\}$ + $\{2,5\}$ = $\{1+2,1+5,4+2,4+5\}$ = $\{3,6,6,9\}$ = $\{0,3\}$ =$H$.
	
	\item
	The inverse of $1+H$ is $2+H$.
	\item
	The index of $H$ in $G$ is $3$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 Let $G$ = $V_{15}$ = $\{1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14\}$ and $H$ =  $\{1,11\}$. $H$ is normal in $G$ (why?). The four cosets of $H$ are $H$, $2H$ = $\{2,7\}$,  $4H$ = $\{4,14\}$, and  $8H$ =   $\{8,13\}$. The quotient group table is:


\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
		& $H$ & $2H$ & $4H$ & $8H$  \\ \hline
		$H$  & $H$ & $2H$ & $4H$ & $8H$  \\
		$2H$ & $2H$ & $4H$ & $8H$ & $H$  \\

This type of structure should ring a bell.  As in the integers $\Z$, in a ring we can add, subtract, multiply and even distribute.  So think of $\Z$ as our model of a ring.\\
\underline{Definition.} A \underline{ring} $R$ \index{ring} is a set with two binary operations such that
\begin{description}
\item[\quad(a)]$R$ is an abelian group under addition.
\item[\quad(b)]$R$ is closed and associative under multiplication.
\item[\quad(c)]Multiplication is distributive over addition, ie, $a(b+c)=ab+ac$ and $(b+c)a=ba+ca$.
\end{description}
A \underline{commutative ring} is a ring where $ab=ba$.\\

\underline{Definition.} If a ring $R$ has a multiplicative identity $1$, then an element $a$ in $R$ is an \underline{invertible}\index{invertible} if there is an $a^{-1}$ such that $a\,a^{-1}=1$; $1$ is called the \underline{unity}.\index{unity of a ring}\\

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
 $2\Z$ is a commutative ring with no unity.
\end{tcexample}

\begin{tcexample}{}{}
$ (\Z,\oplus,\otimes) $ is a ring where $ a\oplus b=a+b-1 $ and $ a\otimes b= a+b-ab $. Closure under $ \oplus $ is clear since $ a\oplus b= a+b-1\in \Z $. The additive identity is 1 since $ a\oplus 1 = a+1-1=a=1\oplus a$. The inverse of $ a $ is $ 2-a $ since $ a\oplus (2-a)=a+2-a-1=1. $ The binary operation $ \oplus $ is associative since:\\
$ a\oplus(b\oplus c)=a\oplus (b+c-1)=a+b+c-2 $ and $ (a\oplus b)\oplus c= (a+b-1)\oplus c= a+b-1+c-1=a+b+c-2. $\\
Closure under multiplication is clear since $ a \otimes b= a+b-ab\in \Z $. Finally, we check distributivity: $ a\otimes (b \oplus c)= a \otimes (b+c-1)= a+b+c-1-(ab+ac-a) $ and $ ( a \otimes b)\oplus (a \otimes c)= (a+b-ab)\oplus (a+c-ac)= 2a+b+c-ab-ac-1. $ The reader should check that $ \otimes $ is associative.

	\item[6.] $ x=1 $ or $ x=-1. $ If $ x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)\equiv 0(p) $, then $ x=1  $ or $ x=-1 $. Since $ (x+1)-(x-1)=2 $, either $ p \vert (x+1) $ or $ p \vert (x-1) $, but not both. 
	
	\item Hints: $ 30 \equiv -29(59) $ and $ 31\equiv -30(61) $.

%%%%% 5.LAGRANGE'S THEOREM %%%%%
~\\[.1in]
{\Large 5. \underline{Lagrange's Theorem}}

\begin{oddenumerate}
	\item  $ H=\{0,6\} $, $ 1+H=\{1,7\} $, $ 2+H=\{2,8\}, 3+H=\{3,9\}, 4+H=\{4,10\}, $ and $ 5+H=\{5,11\}. $ 
	
	\item $ V_9=\{1,2,4,5,7,8\}; H=\{1,8\}, 2H=\{2,7\}, 4H=\{4,5\}$. $ \{1,4,7\} $ is another subgroup. 
	
	\item If $ o(G)=p, $ then by Lagrange's Theorem every element $ g\neq e $ has order $ p $. So any one of these is a generator. 
	
	\item $ 1,3,5,9,15,45. $
	
	\item $ H=\{e,a^{13}, a^{26},\dots ,a^{78}\} $ has order 7; hence the index is 13.

%%%%% 6.ISOMORPHISMS %%%%%
~\\[.1in]
{\Large 6. \underline{Isomorphisms}}

\begin{oddenumerate}
	\item $\theta(x)=2x.$ 
	
	\item For onto, choose $ b\in \mathbb{R}^+ $, then solve $ 2^x=b  $ for $ x=\log_2b $. For one-to-one, if $ a\neq b \text{ in } \mathbb{R},  2^a \neq 2^b$ in $ \mathbb{R}^+. $
	
	\item Try $ \theta(x)=\ln x $.
	
	\item $ \theta(e)\theta(e)=\theta(ee)=\theta(e)=e'\theta(e). $ Right cancellation gives $ \theta(e)=e'. $ $ xx^{-1}=e $ gives $ \theta(x)\theta(x^{-1})=\theta(e)=e' $ and so $ \theta(x^{-1})=[\theta(x)]^{-1} $.
	
	\item Let $ \theta(a)=a' $ and let $ o(a)=q $ and $ o(a')=q' $, then $ e=a^q $ and $ \theta(a^q)=[\theta(a)]^{q} $. So $ [\theta(a)]^q=e'. $ Since $ q' $ is the least integer $ m $ with $ [\theta (a)]^m=e', $ we have $ q \geq q' $. Similarly, $ q'\geq q $ and hence $ q=q'. $
	
	\item Since $ \sqrt{xy}=\sqrt{x}\sqrt{y} $, $ \theta(xy)=\theta(x)\theta(y). $ $ \theta $ is one-to-one and onto. 
	
	\item $ V_{12}=\{1,5,7,11\}.~ \theta(1)=1, \theta(3)=5, \theta(5)=7, \theta(7)=11 $ is an isomorphism. Alternatively, they are both Klein 4-groups. 
	
	\item $ -1 $ has order $ 2 $ in $ (\mathbb{R}^*,\times) $, but $ (\mathbb{R}^+,\times) $ has no element of order $ 2 $, since $ x^2=1 \implies x=1 $.
	
	\item Let $ a\in \mathbb{Q} $ and suppose $\theta(a)=-1$; $-1$ must have a preimage if $\theta$ is an isomorphism. Then $-1=\theta (\frac{a}{2}+\frac{a}{2}) = [\theta(\frac{a}{2})]^2$, a contradiction.

	\item $ \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_5$ is one possibility. How about $ [(2,0)] $ or $ [(10,4)] $. There are others. 
	
	\item $ o(9)=10; o(21)=10 $. $ 9 $ is the inverse of $ 21 $ since $ 9+21\equiv 0 $. In general, $ o(x)= o(x^{-1}) .$
	
	\item Let $ G_1 $ and $ G_2 $ be Abelian groups. Choose $(a,b) \text{ and } (c,d)\in G_1\times G_2.$ Then $(a,b)(c,d)=(ac,bd)=(ca,db)=(c,d)(a,b) $.

	\item $ H=\{e,a^3,a^6,a^9,a^{12},a^{15},a^{18}\}; G/H=\{H,aH,a^2H\} $
	
	\item If the index is 2, there are only two cosets, say $ H $ and $ aH $. But then $ Ha $ must be either $ H $ or $ aH $, so $ Ha=Ha $ since $ Ha\neq H. $
	
	\item $ 001+H=\{001,010\}, 100+H=\{100,111\}, 101+H=\{101,110\}. $
